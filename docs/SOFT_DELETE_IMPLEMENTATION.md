# Budget Soft Delete Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The soft delete system has been successfully implemented for the Budget model in Wallai.

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### 1. **Migration: `apps/budgets/migrations/0010_add_soft_delete_fields.py`**
- Adds `deleted_at` (DateTimeField) and `deleted_by` (ForeignKey to User) fields
- Creates optimization indexes:
  - `idx_budget_deleted_at` - for filtering deleted records
  - `idx_budget_active_lookup` - for efficient active budget queries

### 2. **Custom Manager: `apps/budgets/managers.py`**
- `BudgetManager` with methods:
  - `active()` - get only active (non-deleted) budgets
  - `deleted()` - get only soft-deleted budgets
  - `all_including_deleted()` - get all budgets including deleted
  - `soft_delete(pk, deleted_by)` - soft delete a budget
  - `restore(pk, restored_by)` - restore a soft-deleted budget
  - `hard_delete(pk)` - permanently delete (use with caution)
  - `get_with_deleted(pk)` - get budget including deleted ones

### 3. **Model Updates: `apps/budgets/models.py`**
- Added soft delete fields:
  ```python
  deleted_at = models.DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)
  deleted_by = models.ForeignKey(User, ...)
  ```
- Custom manager: `objects = BudgetManager()`
- Instance methods:
  - `soft_delete(deleted_by)` - soft delete this budget
  - `restore()` - restore this budget
  - `is_deleted` property - check if budget is deleted

### 4. **Rollback Script: `rollback_soft_delete.py`**
- Complete rollback functionality in case of issues
- Checks for soft-deleted data before rollback
- Option to restore soft-deleted records
- Instructions for manual cleanup

## 🔧 Usage Examples

```python
from apps.budgets.models import Budget

# Get only active budgets
active_budgets = Budget.objects.active()

# Get deleted budgets
deleted_budgets = Budget.objects.deleted()

# Soft delete a budget
budget = Budget.objects.get(pk=1)
budget.soft_delete(deleted_by=user)

# Restore a budget
budget.restore()

# Check if deleted
if budget.is_deleted:
    print("Budget is deleted")

# Manager methods
Budget.objects.soft_delete(pk=1, deleted_by=user)
Budget.objects.restore(pk=1)
```

## ✅ Database Changes Verified

- Migration `0010_add_soft_delete_fields` applied successfully
- Database fields confirmed via `inspectdb`:
  - `deleted_at` (datetime, nullable)
  - `deleted_by` (foreign key to users table, nullable)
- Optimization indexes created

## 🛡️ Safety Features

1. **Preservation of Relations**: Soft delete maintains all FK relationships
2. **Audit Trail**: Tracks who deleted and when
3. **Rollback Capability**: Complete rollback script provided
4. **Data Recovery**: Easy restoration of soft-deleted records
5. **Query Optimization**: Indexes for efficient active/deleted filtering

## 🧪 Testing

To test the implementation:

```bash
# Verify migration
python manage.py showmigrations budgets

# Check database schema
python manage.py sqlmigrate budgets 0010

# Inspect actual database
python manage.py inspectdb --include-views budgets | findstr "deleted"
```

## 📋 Definition of Done Status

✅ Migration executes without errors
✅ Budget.objects.active() manager functional
✅ Soft delete preserves relationships
✅ Rollback script available
✅ Optimization indexes created
✅ Audit trail implemented (deleted_by, deleted_at)

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, run:

```bash
python rollback_soft_delete.py
```

This will:
1. Check for soft-deleted data
2. Optionally restore soft-deleted records
3. Remove optimization indexes
4. Rollback migration to 0009
5. Provide manual cleanup instructions
