üõ† TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

New Models Structure:

class Budget(models.Model): # Existing fields +
timing_type = models.CharField(choices=[...])
due_date = models.DateField(null=True)
range_start/end = models.DateField(null=True)
is_recurring = models.BooleanField()
recurrence_pattern = models.CharField()

class BudgetTemplate(models.Model):
name = models.CharField()
timing_type = models.CharField()
default_amount = models.DecimalField()
category = models.ForeignKey(BudgetCategory)

class SpendingBehaviorAnalysis(models.Model):
user_space = models.ForeignKey()
category = models.ForeignKey()
preferred_timing = models.JSONField()
pattern_confidence = models.DecimalField()

Smart Features Architecture:

class TimingIntelligence:
def analyze_spending_patterns(user, category)
def suggest_optimal_timing(budget_item)
def generate_smart_reminders(user)
def calculate_timing_score(actual_vs_planned)
