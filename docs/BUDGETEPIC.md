## Notes for Monday Restart

1. **Template System Issue**: There's a session-specific NameError with user `dumck@hotmail.com` accessing `/budgets/templates/` - this appears to be a browser cache issue as server-side testing works perfectly.

2. **Budget Dashboard**: All requested improvements are implemented - if not visible, clear browser cache or try incognito mode.

3. **Hot Reload**: Working perfectly with file watching enabled. Use `python start_dev.py` for enhanced startup messages.

4. **Ready for Next Phase**: Budget system is complete and ready for expense integration in Sprint 3.
